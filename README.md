## Twitchtv JSON API

As described on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api) website the user should be able to:

* See whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
* Click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
* If the Twitch user is currently streaming, see additional details about what they are streaming.
* See a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.

## Know bugs

* The last "user story" has not been fulfilled.
